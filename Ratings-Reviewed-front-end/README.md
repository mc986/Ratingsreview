# Ratings-Reviwed

Reviews are ubiquitous; Amazon, Yelp, etc. depend on user reviews to engage people on their
sites, plus the reviews are very helpful to the other users in deciding whether they want to use
the services/products or not. But the star ratings can be very subjective. The experience of one
user rating a particular business as 3 might be quite equivalent to another userâ€™s experience
who rates it as 5. Design a model that uses the sentiment contained in the written reviews from
the Yelp Academic Dataset(you can use other dataset) and to produce a standardized star
rating.
